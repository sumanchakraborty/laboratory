Known Issues
------------
There are no known problems in this release.

Limitations
-----------
Note the following considerations when using Ansible Modules for Dell
EMC Unity:

-   Storage pools module
    -   Only the get and modify operations are supported in this release.
    -   The create and delete operations are not applicable in 1.0.

-   Consistency groups module
    -   If a consistency group has snapshots, you cannot add or remove volumes from it.
    -   Consistency groups cannot be mapped to a host. Only the individual volumes (LUNs) that comprise the consistency group can be mapped to a host.
    -   If a consistency group has volumes, it cannot be deleted.
    -   Tiering policies cannot be applied to an empty consistency group.

-   Volumes module
    -   You cannot delete a volume that has mapped hosts.
    -   You must first unmap the hosts using the unmap operation for any volumes you need to delete.

-   Snapshot schedules module
    -   Snapshot schedules created using Ansible can only have one rule applied. 
    -   For the create and modify operations, the type is mandatory.
    -   You cannot modify a rule type once the schedule is created. However, you can modify other parameters within the same rule type. 
    -   A rule cannot have both autodelete and a desired retention time set at the same time. These parameters are mutually exclusive.
    -   If an existing snapshot schedule has more than one rule applied to it, only the get and delete operations are available when using Ansible for those snapshots schedules.

-   Host module
    -   Host initiators can only be removed when they are in a logged off state, meaning, there are no active initiator paths associated with the initiator. Software media, organization, and files
